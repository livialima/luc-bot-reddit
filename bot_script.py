"""
   bot-script.py - Pulls the lessons for the Linux Upskill Challenge from Github into the subreddit 

    Note 1: Don't run more that once a day - you'll risk multiple posting 
    
    Note 2: This is basically a "Steve simulator":
         - Steve, in NZ, gets out of bed on a Monday morning
         - Feeds the cats, and makes himself a miso soup
         - Then posts Monday's lesson - (it's about 8 or 9am by this time)
         - However, because this script runs "in the cloud", the server will be 
           running (almost always) on UTC - so the task must be scheduled for
           8PM. But, on Monday morning Steve's time, while it will be 8pm in Greenwich
           and it will be SUNDAY
         - So, the script will run and say "No lesson on a weekend" - not good
         - This is why the "time_bump" variable exists...

    Note 3: This also means that the script can't be run just Monday-Friday (which might 
            seem sensible), but instead should be scheduled EVERY day
